# Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing

  A **European Banking Institution** has provided data related to direct marketing campaigns. The campaigns were based on phone calls to their customers in order to offer **term deposit subscriptions**. 

   In this project, we will build classification models to predict ***whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not*** and also to identify ***the main factors that affect the clientsâ€™ decision.***

## Data Source

The data used for this project are publicly available on UCI Machine Learning repository - [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).
Further details about the dataset is provided in the README file in the [data folder.](https://github.com/MAJgautam/Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing/tree/master/data)

## Analysis

**Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis** is done on the dataset. The plots and the inferences can be found in the [analysis folder.](https://github.com/MAJgautam/Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing/tree/master/analysis)

## Feature Engineering

  **Feature Selection** is done to select the best variables for prediction. 

  A major problem associated with the given dataset is that it is *imbalanced.* So, **SMOTE** - a Synthetic Data Generation sampling method is used to overcome this problem. 
  [Feature Engineering folder](https://github.com/MAJgautam/Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing/tree/master/feature%20engineering) contains the respective code and explanation.


## Algorithms Used

Four different algorithms are used in this project to predict the term deposit subscription.
1.	**Linear algorithm:** Logistic Regression (GLM)
2. 	**Non-Linear algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. 	**Bagging algorithm:** Random Forest (RF)
4. 	**Boosting algorithm:** eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

  The algorithms were assessed using test accuracy, AUC and F1 Score. 
  **Random forest** performed the best among the four algorithms with **87.41% test accuracy, 71.08% AUC and 0.4723 F1 Score**

  R codes for the implementation of all the above algorithms and the prediction are provided in the [prediction folder.](https://github.com/MAJgautam/Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing/tree/master/prediction)


## Result

The prediction on the test data using the **Random Forest algorithm** is stored in the **result.csv** file.


### Note
**R Code** for each step is provided separately in the respective folders along with the README file and also, [**complete R Script**](https://github.com/MAJgautam/Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing/blob/master/complete_code.R) for this whole project is provided for convenience.
