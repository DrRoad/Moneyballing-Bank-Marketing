# Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing

A European Banking Institution has provided data related to direct marketing campaigns. The campaigns were based on phone calls to their customers in order to offer **term deposit subscriptions**. In this project, we will build classification models to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not and also to identify the main factors that affect the clientsâ€™ decision.

# Data Source

The data used for this project is publicly available on UCI Machine Learning repository - [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).
Further details about the dataset is provided in the README file in the data folder.

# Analysis

**Data Cleaning** and an extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis** is done on the dataset. The plots and the inferences can be found in the analysis folder.

# Feature Engineering

**Feature Selection** is done to select the best variables for prediction. A major problem associated with the given dataset is that it is *imbalanced.* So, **SMOTE** - a Synthetic Data Generation sampling method is used to overcome this problem.
