# Moneyballing-Bank-Marketing

A European Banking Institution has provided data related to direct marketing campaigns. The campaigns were based on phone calls to their customers in order to offer **term deposit subscriptions**. In this project, we will build classification models to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not and also to identify the main factors that affect the clientsâ€™ decision.
